Efficient and reliable monitoring of wild animals in their natural habitats is essential to inform conservation and management decisions regarding wildlife species, migration patterns, habitat protection, and is possible, rehabilitation and grouping species of the same animals together. Processing a large volume of images and videos captured from camera traps manually is extremely expensive, time-consuming, and also monotonous. This presents a major obstacle to scientists and ecologists to monitor wildlife in an open environment. In particular, we intend to use animal images dataset and train a convolutional neural network, capable of classifying the image to a particular animal class accurately. This, in turn, can, therefore, speed up research findings, construct more efficient monitoring systems, and subsequent management decisions, having the potential to make significant impacts on the world of ecology and image analysis.
Introduction
Today, with the increasing volatility, necessity, and applications of artificial intelligence, fields like neural networks, and its subsets, machine learning, and deep learning have gained immense momentum. It has become a data-centric model where neural network developers are “training” the network to be “intelligent” and “independent”. The training needs software and tools such as classifiers, which feed huge amounts of data, analyze them, and extract useful features. These features are then used to observe a pattern and train the network to use similar data again the next time it is fed data. Convolutional Neural Network remains to be the most sought-after choice for computer scientists for image recognition, processing, and classification. We propose a fauna image classifier using a convolutional neural network, which will be used to classify images of different species and animals captured in dense forest environments to achieve the desired accuracy, and aid ecologists and researchers to further study and/or improve habitat, environmental and extinction patterns. A convolutional neural network is trained and developed for efficiently classifying these images with accurate results. Images captured in a field represent a challenging task while classifying since they appear in a different pose, background clutter, different illumination, and climatic conditions, human photographic errors can cause significant amounts of distortion, different angles, and occlusions. All these challenges necessitate an efficient algorithm for classification with the most optimum accuracy. One of the biggest issues is “class imbalance”. Since there are an uneven number of pictures for each sample, the algorithm could train some categories better, as compared to the others. The scope of the project is to train a neural network for animal image classifiers based on convolutional neural networks with accurate results, which can be used on animal image datasets, which need more memory allocation, good resolution, consistency in attributes, and good classification.
